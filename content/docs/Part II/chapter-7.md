# 7.1 Foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The journey of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a fascinating one, tracing back to the early days of neural network research. Initially, neural networks were primarily feedforward architectures, which processed inputs in a single pass without considering any temporal dependencies. However, as researchers began to explore the complexities of sequential data, the limitations of feedforward networks became apparent. This led to the development of RNNs, which are specifically designed to handle sequences of data by maintaining a form of memory through their hidden states. The historical evolution of RNNs reflects a growing understanding of how to model time-dependent phenomena, paving the way for their application in various fields such as natural language processing, time series forecasting, and speech recognition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the core of RNNs lies the concept of sequence modeling. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs are capable of processing input sequences of varying lengths. This is achieved through the use of hidden states, which serve as a memory mechanism that captures information from previous time steps. Each hidden state is updated at every time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state, allowing the network to maintain context over time. This unique characteristic enables RNNs to learn temporal dependencies, making them particularly effective for tasks where the order of inputs is crucial.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mathematically, RNNs can be formulated as follows. Given an input sequence \( x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T) \), where \( T \) is the length of the sequence, the hidden state \( h_t \) at time step \( t \) is computed using the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \) and the current input \( x_t \). The update rule can be expressed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
\[
h_t = f(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)
\]
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
where \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are weight matrices, \( b \) is a bias vector, and \( f \) is a non-linear activation function, such as the hyperbolic tangent or ReLU. The output \( y_t \) at each time step can be computed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
\[
y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
\]
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
where \( W_y \) is the weight matrix for the output layer and \( b_y \) is the output bias. The training of RNNs typically involves backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is an extension of the standard backpropagation algorithm. During BPTT, gradients are computed for each time step, allowing the network to learn from the entire sequence rather than just individual inputs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The importance of sequential data cannot be overstated. In natural language processing, for instance, understanding the context of words in a sentence is essential for tasks such as sentiment analysis or machine translation. Similarly, in time series forecasting, capturing trends and patterns over time is critical for making accurate predictions. RNNs excel in these scenarios due to their ability to maintain memory through hidden states, enabling them to learn from past inputs and make informed predictions based on temporal patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key distinctions between RNNs and feedforward networks is the presence of recurrent connections. In a feedforward network, information flows in one direction, from input to output, without any feedback loops. In contrast, RNNs incorporate feedback by allowing the hidden state to influence future computations. This recurrent connection is what enables RNNs to capture temporal dependencies across time steps, making them suitable for tasks that require an understanding of sequences.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the practical application of RNNs, we can implement a basic RNN from scratch in Rust using the <code>tch-rs</code> library, which provides bindings to the popular PyTorch library. Below is a simple example of how to configure the input and hidden layers for sequence data processing.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use tch::{nn, nn::OptimizerConfig, Device, Tensor};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct RNN {
    rnn: nn::RNN,
}

impl RNN {
    fn new(vs: &nn::Path, input_size: i64, hidden_size: i64) -> RNN {
        let rnn = nn::rnn(vs, input_size, hidden_size, Default::default());
        RNN { rnn }
    }

    fn forward(&self, input: Tensor, hidden: Tensor) -> (Tensor, Tensor) {
        let (output, hidden) = self.rnn.forward(&input, &hidden);
        (output, hidden)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let vs = nn::VarStore::new(device);
    let input_size = 10;
    let hidden_size = 20;
    let rnn = RNN::new(&vs.root(), input_size, hidden_size);

    let input = Tensor::randn(&[5, 3, input_size], (tch::Kind::Float, device)); // Batch of 5 sequences, each of length 3
    let hidden = Tensor::zeros(&[1, 5, hidden_size], (tch::Kind::Float, device)); // Initial hidden state

    let (output, hidden) = rnn.forward(input, hidden);
    println!("Output: {:?}", output);
    println!("Hidden state: {:?}", hidden);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define a simple RNN structure that utilizes the <code>tch-rs</code> library to create an RNN layer. The <code>forward</code> method processes an input tensor and returns the output along with the updated hidden state. The main function demonstrates how to initialize the RNN and perform a forward pass with a batch of input sequences.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further solidify our understanding, we can build and train a simple RNN for a time series prediction task. For instance, we could use an RNN to predict the next value in a sine wave sequence. By training the model on a dataset of sine wave values, we can leverage the RNN's ability to learn temporal patterns and make accurate predictions based on previous values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks are built upon the need to model sequential data effectively. Their historical journey reflects a significant advancement in neural network architectures, enabling the capture of temporal dependencies through hidden states and recurrent connections. By understanding the mathematical formulation and practical implementation of RNNs, we can harness their power for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing to time series forecasting. As we continue to explore RNNs in Rust, we will uncover more advanced techniques and architectures that enhance their capabilities in handling complex sequential tasks.
</p>

# 7.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks represent a significant advancement in the field of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem that often plagues traditional RNN architectures. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients used in the backpropagation process become exceedingly small, leading to ineffective learning for long sequences. This limitation makes it challenging for standard RNNs to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for tasks such as language modeling, time series prediction, and more. LSTMs tackle this issue through a sophisticated architecture that incorporates memory cells and gating mechanisms, allowing them to retain information over extended periods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The architecture of an LSTM cell is fundamentally different from that of a standard RNN. Each LSTM cell contains three primary components: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. The forget gate determines which information from the previous cell state should be discarded. It takes the current input and the previous hidden state as inputs, passing them through a sigmoid activation function to produce a value between 0 and 1 for each element in the cell state. A value of 0 indicates that the information should be completely forgotten, while a value of 1 signifies that it should be retained. The input gate, on the other hand, controls what new information should be added to the cell state. It also utilizes a sigmoid activation function to decide which values to update, combined with a tanh activation function to create a vector of new candidate values that could be added to the state. Finally, the output gate determines what information from the cell state should be outputted to the next layer. This gate uses the current input and the previous hidden state to produce an output that is filtered through a sigmoid function, which is then multiplied by the tanh of the cell state to produce the final output.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The significance of memory cells in LSTM networks cannot be overstated. These memory cells serve as a mechanism for capturing long-term dependencies, allowing the network to retain relevant information over many time steps. By utilizing the controlled gating mechanisms, LSTMs can effectively manage the flow of information, deciding when to forget, when to update, and when to output information. This capability is particularly important in applications where context and historical data play a critical role, such as in natural language processing tasks where the meaning of a word can depend heavily on the words that precede it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When considering the trade-offs between using simple RNNs and LSTMs, it is essential to recognize the differences in computational complexity and the ability to learn long-term dependencies. While LSTMs are more complex due to their additional gates and memory cells, this complexity comes with the benefit of improved performance on tasks that require the retention of information over long sequences. In contrast, simple RNNs may be faster to train and require fewer resources, but they often struggle to learn from data with long-term dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in many scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The impact of gate configurations on the model's ability to selectively forget, update, and output information is another critical aspect of LSTMs. By experimenting with different configurations of gates and memory cells, practitioners can optimize the performance of their models for specific tasks. For instance, adjusting the size of the memory cells or the number of units in each gate can lead to significant changes in how well the model captures long-term dependencies. Additionally, tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates and batch sizes can further enhance the model's ability to learn from complex datasets.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement an LSTM network in Rust, one can leverage libraries such as <code>tch-rs</code>, which provides bindings to the PyTorch library, or <code>burn</code>, a Rust-native deep learning framework. Below is a simplified example of how one might define an LSTM model using <code>tch-rs</code>. This example outlines the basic structure of an LSTM network, demonstrating how to create the model and prepare it for training on a dataset with long-term dependencies.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use tch::{nn, nn::Module, nn::OptimizerConfig, Device, Tensor};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct LSTMModel {
    lstm: nn::LSTM,
    linear: nn::Linear,
}

impl LSTMModel {
    fn new(vs: &nn::Path) -> LSTMModel {
        let lstm = nn::LSTM::new(vs, 10, 20, Default::default()); // input_size=10, hidden_size=20
        let linear = nn::Linear::new(vs, 20, 1); // output_size=1
        LSTMModel { lstm, linear }
    }
}

impl nn::Module for LSTMModel {
    fn forward(&self, input: &Tensor) -> Tensor {
        let (output, _) = self.lstm.forward(input, None);
        self.linear.forward(&output)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let vs = nn::VarStore::new(device);
    let model = LSTMModel::new(&vs.root());

    // Example input: a sequence of length 5 with 10 features
    let input = Tensor::randn(&[5, 1, 10], (tch::Kind::Float, device));
    let output = model.forward(&input);
    
    println!("{:?}", output);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define an <code>LSTMModel</code> struct that encapsulates an LSTM layer and a linear layer for output. The <code>forward</code> method processes the input through the LSTM and then through the linear layer. This model can be trained on a dataset with long-term dependencies, such as text data for language modeling. By experimenting with different configurations of the LSTM, such as varying the number of hidden units or adjusting the learning rate, one can optimize the model's performance for specific tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, LSTM networks have revolutionized the way we approach sequential data, providing a robust solution to the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNNs. Their unique architecture, characterized by memory cells and gating mechanisms, enables them to effectively capture long-term dependencies in data. By understanding the fundamental and practical aspects of LSTMs, practitioners can harness their power to tackle complex problems in various domains, from natural language processing to time series forecasting.
</p>

# 7.3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) represent a significant advancement in the field of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), offering a simplified yet effective alternative to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. While LSTMs have been widely adopted for their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, GRUs streamline this architecture, making them particularly appealing for tasks where computational efficiency is paramount. The essence of GRUs lies in their ability to maintain performance while reducing the complexity inherent in LSTMs, which can be advantageous in various applications, from natural language processing to time series forecasting.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the core of a GRU cell are two primary components: the update gate and the reset gate. The update gate determines how much of the past information needs to be passed along to the future, effectively controlling the flow of information through the network. This gate allows the GRU to retain relevant information over time, similar to the memory cell in LSTMs. The reset gate, on the other hand, decides how much of the past information to forget. By utilizing these two gates, GRUs can dynamically adjust their memory, enabling them to learn dependencies in the data without the need for a separate memory cell, as seen in LSTMs. This architectural simplification not only reduces the number of parameters but also enhances the training speed, making GRUs a popular choice for many machine learning practitioners.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When comparing GRUs to LSTMs, one can observe that while both architectures are designed to handle sequential data, GRUs achieve similar performance with fewer parameters. LSTMs typically consist of three gates (input, output, and forget gates) and a memory cell, which can lead to increased computational overhead. In contrast, GRUs merge the input and forget gates into a single update gate and eliminate the memory cell, resulting in a more streamlined architecture. This reduction in complexity often translates to faster training times and lower resource consumption, making GRUs particularly suitable for applications with limited computational power or time constraints. Empirical studies have shown that GRUs can match or even outperform LSTMs on certain tasks, particularly when the dataset is not excessively large or complex.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement a GRU network in Rust, one can leverage libraries such as <code>tch-rs</code>, which provides bindings to the PyTorch library, or <code>burn</code>, a Rust-native machine learning framework. Below is a simplified example of how one might set up a GRU model using <code>tch-rs</code>. This example demonstrates the creation of a GRU layer and its integration into a basic neural network for a sequential task, such as sentiment analysis.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use tch::{nn, nn::Module, nn::OptimizerConfig, Device, Tensor};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct GruModel {
    gru: nn::Gru,
    linear: nn::Linear,
}

impl GruModel {
    fn new(vs: &nn::Path, input_size: i64, hidden_size: i64, output_size: i64) -> GruModel {
        let gru = nn::gru(vs, input_size, hidden_size, Default::default());
        let linear = nn::linear(vs, hidden_size, output_size, Default::default());
        GruModel { gru, linear }
    }
}

impl nn::Module for GruModel {
    fn forward(&self, input: &Tensor, hidden: &Tensor) -> Tensor {
        let (output, hidden) = self.gru.forward(input, hidden);
        self.linear.forward(&output)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let vs = nn::VarStore::new(device);
    let input_size = 10;
    let hidden_size = 20;
    let output_size = 1;

    let model = GruModel::new(&vs.root(), input_size, hidden_size, output_size);
    let input = Tensor::randn(&[5, 3, input_size], (tch::Kind::Float, device)); // Batch of 5 sequences
    let hidden = Tensor::zeros(&[1, 3, hidden_size], (tch::Kind::Float, device)); // Initial hidden state

    let output = model.forward(&input, &hidden);
    println!("{:?}", output.size());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define a <code>GruModel</code> struct that encapsulates a GRU layer and a linear output layer. The <code>forward</code> method processes the input tensor through the GRU and subsequently through the linear layer, producing the final output. The model is initialized with random input data, simulating a batch of sequences, and an initial hidden state. This setup serves as a foundation for training the GRU model on a specific dataset.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Training the GRU model on a sequential dataset, such as sentiment analysis or time series forecasting, involves feeding the model with input sequences and adjusting the weights based on the loss calculated from the predictions. By comparing the performance of GRUs and LSTMs on the same task, one can analyze the trade-offs in accuracy and training efficiency. In many cases, GRUs may yield comparable results to LSTMs while requiring less computational power and time, making them an attractive option for practitioners looking to balance performance with resource constraints.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, Gated Recurrent Units offer a compelling alternative to LSTMs, simplifying the architecture while retaining the ability to model complex sequential dependencies. The introduction of update and reset gates allows GRUs to effectively manage memory and information flow, resulting in reduced computational complexity and faster training times. As machine learning continues to evolve, GRUs stand out as a practical choice for a wide range of applications, particularly in scenarios where efficiency is critical.
</p>

# 7.4 Advanced RNN Architectures
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, particularly in the context of sequential data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have established themselves as a powerful tool for modeling temporal dependencies. However, as the complexity of tasks increases, the need for more sophisticated architectures becomes apparent. This section delves into advanced RNN architectures, specifically Bidirectional RNNs, Deep RNNs, and Attention Mechanisms, which enhance the capabilities of traditional RNNs and enable them to tackle more challenging problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bidirectional RNNs represent a significant advancement in the way sequential data is processed. Unlike standard RNNs that only consider past information when making predictions, Bidirectional RNNs are designed to capture information from both past and future time steps. This is achieved by employing two separate RNNs: one processes the input sequence in the forward direction, while the other processes it in the backward direction. The outputs from both RNNs are then combined, allowing the model to leverage context from both sides of a given time step. This dual perspective is particularly beneficial in tasks where the context surrounding a data point is crucial for accurate predictions, such as in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Deep RNNs, on the other hand, introduce the concept of stacking multiple RNN layers to learn hierarchical features over sequences. By stacking RNN layers, the model can capture increasingly abstract representations of the input data at each layer. The lower layers may focus on capturing local patterns, while the higher layers can learn more global, complex features. This hierarchical learning is essential for tasks that require understanding of both fine-grained details and overarching structures within the data. However, while deep RNNs can significantly enhance model performance, they also introduce challenges such as vanishing gradients, which can hinder the training process. Techniques such as gradient clipping and careful initialization are often employed to mitigate these issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of attention mechanisms into RNN architectures has further revolutionized the field of sequence modeling. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when making predictions, rather than treating all input elements equally. This selective focus is particularly advantageous in tasks such as machine translation, where certain words in a source sentence may be more relevant to a specific target word than others. By incorporating attention, RNNs can dynamically weigh the importance of different input elements, leading to improved performance and interpretability of the model's decisions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the implementation of these advanced RNN architectures in Rust, we can utilize libraries such as <code>tch-rs</code> or <code>burn</code>. For instance, a simple implementation of a Bidirectional RNN using <code>tch-rs</code> might look like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use tch::{nn, Device, Tensor, nn::Module};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct BiRNN {
    rnn: nn::RNN,
}

impl BiRNN {
    fn new(vs: &nn::Path) -> BiRNN {
        let rnn = nn::RNN::new(vs, 10, 20, /*num_layers=*/ 2, /*bidirectional=*/ true);
        BiRNN { rnn }
    }
}

impl nn::Module for BiRNN {
    fn forward(&self, input: &Tensor) -> Tensor {
        let (output, _) = self.rnn.forward(input, None);
        output
    }
}

fn main() {
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let vs = nn::VarStore::new(device);
    let model = BiRNN::new(&vs.root());

    let input = Tensor::randn(&[5, 3, 10], (tch::Kind::Float, device)); // (seq_len, batch_size, input_size)
    let output = model.forward(&input);
    println!("{:?}", output.size());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define a <code>BiRNN</code> struct that encapsulates a bidirectional RNN layer. The <code>forward</code> method processes the input tensor and returns the output, which contains the combined information from both directions. This simple implementation serves as a foundation for building more complex models that can be trained on various sequential datasets, such as those used in machine translation or speech recognition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As we explore the practical aspects of implementing these advanced RNN architectures, it is crucial to consider the datasets we choose for training. Complex sequential datasets often require careful preprocessing and feature extraction to ensure that the models can learn effectively. Additionally, experimenting with attention mechanisms can provide valuable insights into how different parts of the input sequence contribute to the model's predictions. By analyzing the attention weights, we can gain a better understanding of the model's decision-making process, which can be particularly useful in domains where interpretability is essential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, advanced RNN architectures such as Bidirectional RNNs, Deep RNNs, and Attention Mechanisms significantly enhance the capabilities of traditional RNNs. By capturing information from multiple perspectives, learning hierarchical features, and focusing on relevant parts of the input sequence, these architectures enable us to tackle a wide range of complex sequential tasks. As we continue to explore the potential of RNNs in Rust, we will uncover new techniques and strategies for improving model performance and interpretability in the ever-evolving landscape of machine learning.
</p>

# 7.5 Training and Optimizing RNNs in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a crucial aspect of developing effective models for sequence prediction tasks. The training process involves several key components, including loss functions, backpropagation through time (BPTT), and optimization algorithms. In this section, we will delve into these components, discuss the challenges associated with training RNNs, and explore various techniques to optimize their performance in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the core of training any neural network, including RNNs, is the loss function, which quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values. Common loss functions for sequence prediction tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks. Once the loss is computed, the next step is to update the model's weights to minimize this loss. This is where the BPTT algorithm comes into play. BPTT is an extension of the traditional backpropagation algorithm, adapted to handle the temporal dependencies inherent in RNNs. It involves unfolding the RNN through time, treating each time step as a separate layer, and then calculating gradients for each weight across all time steps. This allows the model to learn from sequences of data, adjusting weights based on the accumulated gradients.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, training RNNs is fraught with challenges. One of the most significant issues is the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. When gradients are propagated back through many time steps, they can become exceedingly small (vanishing) or excessively large (exploding), leading to ineffective learning or numerical instability. This is particularly problematic for long sequences, where the gradients can diminish to near-zero values, preventing the model from learning long-range dependencies. To mitigate these issues, techniques such as gradient clipping can be employed. Gradient clipping involves setting a threshold for the gradients; if the gradients exceed this threshold, they are scaled down to prevent them from exploding. This simple yet effective technique can significantly enhance the stability of RNN training.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another challenge in training RNNs is the long training times often required to achieve convergence. RNNs typically have many parameters, and the sequential nature of their computations can lead to inefficiencies in training. To address this, various optimization algorithms can be utilized, such as Adam, RMSprop, or even traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD). These optimizers adjust the learning rate dynamically based on the gradients, which can help speed up convergence and improve the overall training process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Regularization techniques also play a vital role in training RNNs. Overfitting is a common concern, especially when the model is complex and the training dataset is limited. One effective regularization technique is dropout, which involves randomly setting a fraction of the neurons to zero during training. This prevents the model from becoming overly reliant on any single neuron and encourages it to learn more robust features. Implementing dropout in an RNN can be slightly more complex than in feedforward networks due to the recurrent connections, but it is essential for improving generalization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical terms, implementing training loops, loss functions, and optimizers for RNNs in Rust requires a solid understanding of both the Rust programming language and the underlying mathematical principles of neural networks. Rust's performance characteristics make it an excellent choice for building efficient machine learning models. To illustrate this, consider the following example of a simple training loop for an RNN in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn train_rnn(rnn: &mut RNN, data: &Vec<Sequence>, epochs: usize, learning_rate: f64) {
    for epoch in 0..epochs {
        let mut total_loss = 0.0;
        for sequence in data {
            let output = rnn.forward(sequence.inputs);
            let loss = compute_loss(output, sequence.targets);
            total_loss += loss;

            let gradients = rnn.backward(sequence.targets);
            rnn.update_weights(learning_rate, gradients);
        }
        println!("Epoch {}: Loss = {}", epoch, total_loss / data.len() as f64);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code snippet, we define a <code>train_rnn</code> function that takes an RNN model, a dataset of sequences, the number of epochs, and a learning rate as inputs. The function iterates through the dataset, computes the forward pass, calculates the loss, performs the backward pass to obtain gradients, and updates the weights accordingly. This simple structure can be expanded to include features like gradient clipping and learning rate schedules.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further optimize RNN training, experimenting with different learning rates and gradient clipping thresholds is essential. For instance, a learning rate that is too high can lead to divergence, while one that is too low can slow down convergence.
