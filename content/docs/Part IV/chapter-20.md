# 20.1 Introduction to Model Deployment and Scaling
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, the journey does not conclude with the training of a model; rather, it extends into the critical phase of deployment. Model deployment refers to the process of transitioning a trained model from a controlled development environment into a production setting where it can be utilized for real-world applications. This transition is pivotal as it allows users, applications, or other systems to access the model's capabilities, thereby transforming theoretical insights into practical solutions. The deployment phase is not merely a technical necessity; it is a crucial step that determines the model's usability and effectiveness in addressing real-world problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The importance of deployment cannot be overstated. A well-deployed model can serve predictions to end-users, integrate seamlessly with existing systems, and provide valuable insights that drive decision-making processes. However, deploying a model is fraught with challenges. These challenges often include ensuring low latency, maintaining high throughput, and guaranteeing reliability under varying loads. Latency refers to the time taken for the model to respond to a request, while throughput indicates the number of requests the model can handle in a given timeframe. Reliability, on the other hand, pertains to the model's ability to perform consistently over time, even under stress. Addressing these challenges is essential for creating a robust deployment strategy that meets user expectations and business requirements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to deployment, scaling is another critical aspect of managing machine learning models in production. Scaling involves adjusting resources and infrastructure to accommodate increased demand, ensuring that the model performs efficiently regardless of the load. There are two primary strategies for scaling: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling, also known as "scaling up," involves increasing the resources (such as CPU, memory, or storage) on a single node. This approach can be straightforward but may reach a limit where further enhancements become impractical or too costly. Conversely, horizontal scaling, or "scaling out," entails adding more nodes to distribute the load across multiple machines. This method can provide greater flexibility and resilience, allowing systems to handle spikes in demand more effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When deploying machine learning models, particularly deep learning models, it is essential to understand the concept of inference. Inference is the process of running the model on new data to generate predictions in a production environment. This step is crucial as it transforms the model's learned patterns into actionable insights. However, inference can introduce additional complexities, such as the need for optimized performance and resource management. The choice of deployment strategy can significantly impact inference performance, leading to trade-offs that must be carefully considered.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the deployment process in Rust, we can set up a basic deployment pipeline that encompasses building, packaging, and deploying a model. Rust's strong performance characteristics and safety guarantees make it an excellent choice for deploying machine learning models. For instance, we can leverage frameworks like Actix-web or Rocket to create a REST API that serves our model's predictions. Below is a simplified example of how one might implement a REST API using Actix-web to serve a machine learning model.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};
use serde_json::json;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Model {
    // Placeholder for model parameters
}

impl Model {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // Load or initialize the model here
        Model {}
    }

    fn predict(&self, input: Vec<f32>) -> Vec<f32> {
        // Implement the prediction logic here
        input.iter().map(|x| x * 2.0).collect() // Dummy prediction logic
    }
}

async fn predict(model: web::Data<Model>, input: web::Json<Vec<f32>>) -> impl Responder {
    let predictions = model.predict(input.into_inner());
    web::Json(predictions)
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let model = web::Data::new(Model::new());
    HttpServer::new(move || {
        App::new()
            .app_data(model.clone())
            .route("/predict", web::post().to(predict))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define a simple <code>Model</code> struct that encapsulates our machine learning model. The <code>predict</code> method simulates the model's prediction logic. We then set up an Actix-web server that listens for POST requests on the <code>/predict</code> endpoint. When a request is received, the server invokes the <code>predict</code> function, which utilizes the model to generate predictions based on the input data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As we consider scaling strategies, it is essential to evaluate the specific needs of our application. For instance, if we anticipate a steady increase in user requests, horizontal scaling may be the preferred approach, allowing us to add more instances of our API server to handle the load. On the other hand, if our application requires high-performance predictions with minimal latency, vertical scaling might be more appropriate, enabling us to allocate more resources to a single instance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the deployment and scaling of machine learning models in Rust is a multifaceted endeavor that requires careful consideration of various factors, including latency, throughput, reliability, and resource management. By understanding the challenges and trade-offs associated with different deployment strategies, we can create robust solutions that effectively serve the needs of users and applications in a dynamic production environment. As we delve deeper into this chapter, we will explore more advanced deployment techniques and scaling strategies that can further enhance the performance and accessibility of machine learning models in Rust.
</p>

# 20.2 Building Deployable Models in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, the transition from model training to deployment is a critical phase that can significantly influence the performance and usability of the model in real-world applications. Building deployable models in Rust involves a series of steps that ensure the trained model can be seamlessly integrated into production systems. This process begins with exporting the trained model to a format that is compatible with various deployment environments. Common formats for model export include ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) and TorchScript, which facilitate interoperability between different frameworks and languages. By leveraging these formats, developers can ensure that their models are not only portable but also maintain the integrity of the learned parameters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Serialization plays a pivotal role in the deployment of machine learning models. It involves saving the model's architecture and weights in a structured format that can be easily loaded later for inference. In Rust, libraries such as <code>serde</code> provide robust serialization capabilities, allowing developers to convert complex data structures into a format that can be stored or transmitted. When it comes to model deployment, the choice of serialization format can impact both the size of the model and the speed of loading it into memory. For instance, exporting a model to ONNX format can significantly reduce the overhead associated with loading the model, as ONNX is optimized for performance and can be executed on various platforms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Optimizing models for inference is another crucial aspect of deployment. This involves techniques aimed at reducing the model's size and improving its execution speed. During inference, the model is expected to make predictions based on new data, and any inefficiencies can lead to increased latency, which is detrimental in real-time applications. Techniques such as pruning, which involves removing unused layers or parameters, and quantization, which reduces the precision of the weights, can be employed to streamline the model. Furthermore, converting the model to a more efficient representation can also enhance performance. Rustâ€™s strong emphasis on performance and memory safety makes it an excellent choice for implementing these optimizations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the differences between training and inference modes is essential for adapting models for efficient inference. During training, models often require additional overhead for backpropagation and gradient calculations, which are unnecessary during inference. By stripping away these components, developers can create a leaner model that is tailored for making predictions. This adaptation not only improves execution speed but also reduces memory usage, making it more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Model versioning and tracking are vital practices in maintaining consistency and reliability across deployments. As models evolve, it is crucial to keep track of different versions to ensure that the correct model is being used in production. This can prevent issues related to model drift, where the performance of a model degrades over time due to changes in the underlying data distribution. Implementing a systematic approach to versioning can help teams manage updates and rollbacks effectively, ensuring that the deployed model remains reliable and performant.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s features for building lightweight and performant binaries are particularly advantageous for deployment. The language's emphasis on zero-cost abstractions and memory safety allows developers to create applications that are not only efficient but also secure. By compiling Rust code into native binaries, developers can achieve high performance with minimal runtime overhead. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where low latency is critical, such as in real-time inference applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate these concepts in practice, letâ€™s consider an example of implementing model serialization and deserialization in Rust using the <code>serde</code> and <code>tch-rs</code> crates. The <code>tch-rs</code> crate provides bindings to the LibTorch library, enabling the use of PyTorch models in Rust. Below is a simplified example of how to export a trained model to ONNX format and then load it for inference.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::path::Path;
use tch::{nn, Device, Tensor, nn::ModuleT, nn::OptimizerConfig};

fn export_model_to_onnx(model: &impl nn::ModuleT, path: &str) {
    let input_tensor = Tensor::randn(&[1, 3, 224, 224], (tch::Kind::Float, Device::Cpu));
    let output = model.forward(&input_tensor);
    tch::onnx::export(model, &output, path).expect("Failed to export model to ONNX");
}

fn load_model_from_onnx(path: &str) -> impl nn::ModuleT {
    tch::onnx::load(path).expect("Failed to load model from ONNX")
}

fn main() {
    // Assuming `model` is a trained instance of a neural network
    let model = ...; // Your trained model here
    let onnx_path = "model.onnx";

    // Export the model to ONNX format
    export_model_to_onnx(&model, onnx_path);

    // Load the model for inference
    let loaded_model = load_model_from_onnx(onnx_path);
    let input_tensor = Tensor::randn(&[1, 3, 224, 224], (tch::Kind::Float, Device::Cpu));
    let output = loaded_model.forward(&input_tensor);
    println!("{:?}", output);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define functions to export a model to ONNX format and to load it back for inference. The <code>export_model_to_onnx</code> function takes a model and a file path, generates a random input tensor, and exports the model. The <code>load_model_from_onnx</code> function loads the model from the specified ONNX file. This demonstrates the ease with which Rust can handle model serialization and deserialization, making it a powerful tool for deploying machine learning models.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, building deployable models in Rust encompasses a range of practices that ensure models are optimized for performance and reliability. By understanding the nuances of serialization, inference optimization, and versioning, developers can create robust machine learning applications that leverage Rust's strengths. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, the ability to deploy models efficiently will remain a cornerstone of successful implementations.
</p>

# 20.3 Deploying Models in Different Environments
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, deploying models effectively is as crucial as the training process itself. The deployment environment can significantly influence the performance, scalability, and accessibility of a machine learning model. This section delves into the various deployment environments, including cloud, edge, and on-premises solutions, while emphasizing the role of containerization technologies like Docker in simplifying the deployment process. We will also explore the unique considerations that come with each environment, such as network latency in cloud deployments and power efficiency in edge scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When we talk about deployment environments, we primarily refer to the locations and infrastructures where machine learning models are hosted and executed. Cloud environments, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, offer scalable resources that can dynamically adjust to the demands of the application. This scalability is a double-edged sword; while it allows for handling varying loads efficiently, it also introduces complexities related to cost management and network latency. For instance, deploying a model in the cloud can lead to increased latency due to the distance between the data source and the cloud server, which can be a critical factor for real-time applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
On the other hand, edge deployment strategies focus on running models closer to the data source, such as on mobile devices, IoT devices, or edge servers. This approach minimizes latency and enables real-time inference, which is particularly beneficial for applications requiring immediate responses, such as autonomous vehicles or smart home devices. However, deploying models on edge devices comes with its own set of challenges, including limited computational resources and power constraints. Therefore, optimizing models for performance and efficiency is paramount in these scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
On-premises deployment is another critical aspect, especially for organizations dealing with sensitive data or those that must comply with stringent data governance policies. By keeping the model and data within the organization's infrastructure, businesses can maintain greater control over their data and ensure compliance with regulations. However, this approach may limit scalability and flexibility compared to cloud solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To facilitate the deployment process across these varied environments, containerization has emerged as a powerful tool. Docker, for instance, allows developers to encapsulate their machine learning models along with all necessary dependencies into a single container. This encapsulation ensures that the model behaves consistently across different environments, reducing the "it works on my machine" syndrome that often plagues software development. By using Docker, developers can create a Dockerfile that specifies the environment in which the model should run, including the Rust runtime, libraries, and any other dependencies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Dockerfile for a Rust-based machine learning model:
</p>

{{< prism lang="Dockerfile" line-numbers="true">}}
# Use the official Rust image as a base
FROM rust:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Build the Rust application
RUN cargo build --release

# Specify the command to run the application
CMD ["./target/release/myapp"]
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This Dockerfile sets up a Rust environment, compiles the application, and specifies how to run it. Once the Docker image is built, it can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker, whether it be a cloud service, an on-premises server, or an edge device.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For serverless deployments, platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions can be leveraged to run Rust-based models without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. These platforms allow developers to deploy functions that can be triggered by events, such as HTTP requests or changes in data. To deploy a Rust model on AWS Lambda, one would typically compile the Rust code to a binary that is compatible with the Lambda execution environment and then package it along with any necessary dependencies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how to deploy a Rust function on AWS Lambda:
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;">Create a new Rust project and implement the desired functionality.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;">Use the <code>cargo lambda</code> tool to build the project for the Lambda environment.</p>
3. <p style="text-align: justify;">Package the compiled binary and any dependencies into a ZIP file.</p>
4. <p style="text-align: justify;">Upload the ZIP file to AWS Lambda and configure the function settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For edge deployments, WebAssembly (Wasm) has gained traction as a lightweight, portable solution for running Rust models on various devices. By compiling Rust code to Wasm, developers can execute machine learning models directly in the browser or on edge devices without the overhead of a full runtime environment. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require low latency and minimal resource consumption.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To compile a Rust model to Wasm, one would typically use the <code>wasm-pack</code> tool, which streamlines the process of building and packaging Rust code for WebAssembly. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a Rust project for Wasm:
</p>

{{< prism lang="bash" line-numbers="true">}}
# Install wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack

# Create a new Rust project
cargo new my_wasm_model

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my_wasm_model

# Add the wasm-bindgen dependency in Cargo.toml
echo 'wasm-bindgen = "0.2"' >> Cargo.toml

# Write your Rust code in src/lib.rs
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After writing the necessary Rust code, you can build the project using <code>wasm-pack build</code>, which generates the Wasm binary and prepares it for deployment on edge devices or in web applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, deploying machine learning models in different environments requires a nuanced understanding of the unique challenges and considerations associated with each setting. By leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, serverless architectures, and WebAssembly, developers can effectively deploy their Rust-based models across cloud, edge, and on-premises environments, ensuring optimal performance and compliance with data governance policies. As the landscape of machine learning deployment continues to evolve, Rust's performance and safety features make it an increasingly attractive choice for building robust and scalable machine learning applications.
</p>

# 20.4 Scaling Models for High Demand
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, deploying models is only the first step; ensuring that these models can handle varying loads and large numbers of requests without performance degradation is crucial. This section delves into the various scaling techniques that can be employed to achieve this goal, focusing on load balancing, distributed inference, and the importance of monitoring and auto-scaling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scaling techniques are essential for maintaining the responsiveness and reliability of machine learning applications, especially when faced with fluctuating user demands. As the number of requests increases, a single instance of a model may become a bottleneck, leading to increased latency and potential downtime. To mitigate these issues, load balancing plays a pivotal role. Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a deployed model, ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed. This distribution not only enhances performance but also improves fault tolerance, as the failure of one instance does not compromise the entire system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to load balancing, distributed inference is a powerful technique for scaling machine learning models. By running model inference across multiple machines or nodes, organizations can significantly increase throughput. This approach allows for parallel processing of requests, which is particularly beneficial in high-demand environments where response times are critical. Implementing distributed inference requires careful orchestration of resources, and tools like Kubernetes can facilitate this process by managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When considering the architecture for scaling models, it is essential to understand the trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous inference. Synchronous inference requires that each request be processed in real-time, which can lead to increased latency during peak loads. Conversely, asynchronous inference allows for requests to be queued and processed in batches, which can improve throughput but may introduce delays in response times. The choice between these two approaches depends on the specific requirements of the application and the expected load patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Monitoring and auto-scaling are critical components of a robust deployment strategy. By continuously monitoring the performance of deployed models, organizations can gain insights into resource utilization and request patterns. This information can be leveraged to implement auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust resources based on demand. For instance, in a cloud environment, services like AWS Auto Scaling or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) can dynamically allocate or deallocate resources, ensuring that the system remains responsive even during traffic spikes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Caching strategies also play a vital role in reducing the computational load on machine learning models. By storing the results of repeated inference requests, caching can significantly decrease the number of computations required, leading to faster response times and reduced resource consumption. Implementing a caching layer can be done using various techniques, such as in-memory caches or distributed caching systems, depending on the scale and architecture of the application.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the practical implementation of these concepts, consider a scenario where we need to set up a load balancer in Rust to distribute inference requests across multiple instances of a deployed model. Using the <code>hyper</code> crate, we can create a simple HTTP server that acts as a load balancer. Below is a basic example of how this can be achieved:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use hyper::{Body, Request, Response, Server};
use hyper::service::{make_service_fn, service_fn};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

async fn handle_request(req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, hyper::Error> {
    // Here, we would implement logic to route the request to one of the model instances
    // For simplicity, we return a placeholder response
    Ok(Response::new(Body::from("Load balancer response")))
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    let make_svc = make_service_fn(|_conn| async { Ok::<_, hyper::Error>(service_fn(handle_request)) });

    let server = Server::bind(&addr).serve(make_svc);

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);
    if let Err(e) = server.await {
        eprintln!("Server error: {}", e);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we set up a basic HTTP server that listens for incoming requests. The <code>handle_request</code> function is where the load balancing logic would be implemented, routing requests to different model instances based on the current load or other criteria.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For distributed inference, we can leverage Kubernetes to orchestrate our Rust-based model. By containerizing our application and deploying it on a Kubernetes cluster, we can easily scale the number of replicas based on demand. The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can be configured to monitor CPU usage or other metrics, automatically adjusting the number of running instances to maintain optimal performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, experimenting with auto-scaling policies in a cloud environment can provide valuable insights into the behavior of our deployed models under varying loads. By simulating traffic patterns and monitoring resource utilization, we can fine-tune our scaling strategies to ensure that our machine learning applications remain responsive and efficient.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, scaling machine learning models for high demand involves a combination of load balancing, distributed inference, monitoring, and caching strategies. By understanding and implementing these techniques in Rust, developers can create robust and scalable machine learning applications that meet the demands of modern users.
</p>

# 20.5 Monitoring, Logging, and Updating Deployed Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of machine learning, deploying a model is just the beginning of its lifecycle. Once a model is in production, it becomes imperative to monitor its performance and behavior in real-time. This process involves tracking various metrics that can indicate how well the model is functioning, as well as logging events that can provide insights into its operation. Monitoring and logging serve as the backbone of observability, which is crucial for maintaining the health of deployed models. By employing metrics, logs, and traces, developers can diagnose issues, ensure uptime, and maintain the overall integrity of the system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Monitoring a deployed model involves keeping an eye on its performance metrics, which can include accuracy, latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Detecting driftâ€”where the statistical properties of the input data change over timeâ€”is one of the primary challenges in this area. For instance, if a model trained on historical data begins to receive inputs that differ significantly from that data, its predictions may become less reliable. Additionally, latency issues can arise if the model takes too long to respond, which can affect user experience. Failures, whether due to system errors or unexpected input, must also be monitored closely to ensure that the model can handle edge cases gracefully.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Logging plays a critical role in capturing detailed records of model inputs, outputs, and system events. This information is invaluable for debugging and auditing purposes. For example, if a model produces unexpected results, having a log of the inputs that led to those results can help developers trace back through the system to identify the root cause. In Rust, structured logging can be implemented using libraries such as <code>log</code> and <code>serde_json</code>, which allow developers to capture rich contextual information about the model's operation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Updating models in production is another essential aspect of maintaining a machine learning system. As new data becomes available or as the underlying problem changes, it may be necessary to update the model to ensure it continues to perform well. Managing model versions effectively is crucial, as is minimizing downtime during updates. Strategies such as canary deployments and blue-green deployments can be employed to facilitate smooth transitions between model versions. In a canary deployment, a new version of the model is rolled out to a small subset of users first, allowing developers to monitor its performance before a full rollout. In contrast, blue-green deployments involve running two identical environmentsâ€”one with the current version and one with the new versionâ€”allowing for quick switching between the two.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement a monitoring system for a deployed Rust-based model, one can leverage tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus can scrape metrics from the Rust application, which can be exposed via an HTTP endpoint. For example, using the <code>prometheus</code> crate, developers can define custom metrics to track the model's performance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use prometheus::{Encoder, IntCounter, Opts, Registry, TextEncoder};

let registry = Registry::new();
let request_counter = IntCounter::with_opts(Opts::new("model_requests", "Number of model requests"))
    .expect("creating counter failed");
registry.register(Box::new(request_counter.clone())).unwrap();

// In your model prediction function
fn predict(input: &InputData) -> OutputData {
    request_counter.inc(); // Increment the counter for each request
    // Model prediction logic here
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For logging, the <code>log</code> crate can be used in conjunction with a logging implementation such as <code>env_logger</code> or <code>slog</code>. By structuring logs in JSON format, developers can capture detailed information about model predictions and system events:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use log::{info, error};
use serde_json::json;

fn log_prediction(input: &InputData, output: &OutputData) {
    let log_entry = json!({
        "input": input,
        "output": output,
        "timestamp": chrono::Utc::now(),
    });
    info!("{}", log_entry.to_string());
}

// In your model prediction function
fn predict(input: &InputData) -> OutputData {
    let output = model.predict(input);
    log_prediction(input, &output);
    output
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When it comes to updating models, experimenting with different strategies is essential. For instance, if a new model version is deployed and it underperforms, having a rollback mechanism in place can save time and resources. This can be achieved by maintaining a versioning system for models and using feature flags to control which version is currently active. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, monitoring, logging, and updating deployed models are critical components of a robust machine learning system in Rust. By implementing effective monitoring and logging strategies, developers can ensure their models remain reliable and performant over time. Additionally, employing thoughtful update strategies allows for seamless transitions between model versions, ultimately leading to a more resilient and adaptable machine learning deployment.
</p>

# 20.6. Conclusion
