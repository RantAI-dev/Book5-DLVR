      <description>ðŸ’¡&#xA;&amp;quot;I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.&amp;quot; â€” Richard Feynman&#xA;In the field of deep learning, Python has established itself as the de facto standard for neural network implementation, largely due to its user-friendly syntax and extensive libraries. However, in the development of this book, Deep Learning via Rust (DLVR), we have deliberately chosen Rust as the primary programming language.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡&#xA;&amp;quot;The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.&amp;quot; â€” Albert Einstein&#xA;This book, Deep Learning via Rust (DLVR), is an extension of the rigorous academic instruction provided in the Applied Deep Learning course at the Data Science Center (DSC) of the University of Indonesia (UI). The objective of this book is to equip students and practitioners with the most advanced and effective tools for deep learning training and deployment, ensuring they are well-prepared to address the increasingly complex challenges that define the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡&#xA;&amp;quot;The thing that excites me most about deep learning is that it can handle complex data and learn from it, revealing patterns and structures that were previously inaccessible.&amp;quot; â€” Geoffrey Hinton&#xA;Part II of DLVR delves into the diverse architectures that have driven the evolution of deep learning models. It begins with an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), foundational for image processing tasks, and progresses to modern CNN architectures that have set benchmarks in computer vision.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡&#xA;&amp;quot;As we develop more sophisticated models, the challenge is not only to improve their accuracy but to understand how and why they work, to push the boundaries of AI further.&amp;quot; â€” Yoshua Bengio&#xA;Part III of DLVR explores advanced techniques that push the boundaries of what deep learning models can achieve. This section begins with hyperparameter optimization and model tuning, crucial for enhancing model performance and efficiency. It then delves into self-supervised and unsupervised learning, two powerful approaches that allow models to learn from data without requiring extensive labeled datasets.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡&#xA;&amp;quot;AI is the new electricity. Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don&amp;rsquo;t think AI will transform in the next several years.&amp;quot; â€” Andrew Ng&#xA;Part IV of &#34;Deep Learning via Rust&#34; transitions from theory and architecture to practical implementation and application, focusing on how to build, train, deploy, and scale deep learning models using Rust.</description>
